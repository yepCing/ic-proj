{"pageProps":{"articleData":{"id":34,"attributes":{"title":"MRHB DeFi and Sukhavati Labs Partner to Bring Web3 to the World by including Excluded Communities.","date":"2022-03-03","content":"[MRHB DeFi](https://mrhb.network/) is pleased to continue our strategic partnership with [Sukhavati Labs](https://sukhavati.io), a decentralized cloud network service focused on storage. All NFTs minted on the [MRHB DeFi network](https://mrhb.network/) — such as on our [SouqNFT Marketplace](https://souq.mrhb.network) — will be stored in a secure and permissionless manner at a low cost on the decentralized Sukhavati network.\n\nThe key word here is ‘decentralized’ — the vast majority of blockchain protocols out there run on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a centralized platform. Not only does storing NFT metadata on centralized networks come with critical risks, we believe it also runs against the true spirit of decentralization.\n\nBoth [MRHB DeFi](https://mrhb.network/) and Sukhavati strongly believe that the most defining features of cryptocurrency are trustlessness and decentralization. It is critical for the future of crypto that the technology that powers its protocols follow this paradigm.\n\n**We are happy to announce that when artists and collectors create and sell on our SouqNFT platform, they are supporting an ethical economy that runs its transactions in a decentralized manner.**\n\nWe formed this partnership with [Sukhavati](https://sukhavati.io/) last summer, and both our teams have been working hard to ensure the best possible product offerings for our communities. Our deepened partnership with Sukhavati will see more exciting developments for our protocols with more upcoming features launched.\n\n**About MRHB DeFi**\n\n[MRHB DeFi](https://mrhb.network/) is a halal, decentralized finance platform built to embody the true spirit of “Ethical and Inclusive DeFi” by following faith-based financial and business principles where all excluded communities and the world can benefit from the full empowerment potential of DeFi.\n\nThe diverse team comprises researchers, technocrats, influencers, Islamic fintech experts, business entrepreneurs, and industry professionals, who have all come together to ensure that [MRHB DeFi](https://mrhb.network/) prevails in a manner that will impact society as a whole, essentially bridging the gap between faith-conscious communities and the blockchain world.\n\n**MRHB DeFi Official Channels**\n\n[Website](https://mrhb.network/)| [MRHB Reward Dashboard](https://rewards.mrhb.network/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marhabadefi) | [Telegram Chat](https://t.me/mdf_official) | [Telegram Announcements](https://t.me/marhabadefi_ANN) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@mrhbdefi) | [Documents](https://marhabadefi.com/info-centre.php) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MRHB-DeFi-105893235209147/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marhabadefi/) | [Telegram Arabic Community](https://t.me/mdf_arabic) | [Russian Community](https://t.me/mdf_russia) | [Turkish Community](https://t.me/MarhabaDefiTR) |[Persian Community](https://t.me/mrhbdefi_persian) | [Urdu/Hindi Community](https://t.me/MRHBDeFi_Urdu_Hindi)\n\n**About Sukhavati Network**\n\nSukhavati Network is a decentralized cloud network service that is focused on storage.
