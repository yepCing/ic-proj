{"pageProps":{"articleData":{"id":53,"attributes":{"title":"MRHB DeFi releases pioneering whitepaper for an Inclusive DeFi Shariah Compliant platform","date":"2021-08-29","content":"\n\nWe are delighted to announce the release of our [**White Paper**](https://marhabadefi.com/info-centre.php), it’s an important step in realization of our dream to create an ethical, faith-based & secure DeFi solution. MRHB DeFi allows us to present ourselves as truly the most innovative and trusted Shariah compliant project. MRHB DeFi has encapsulated the ethical finance and investment principles of Shariah into the tenets of blockchain to create a suite of halal products and services.\n\nMRHB DeFi is focused on faith-based virtues in financial dealings that seek to promote societal justice, including avoidance and shunning of dishonesty, exploitation, and unjust enrichment. Most prominent are principles regarding the ban on usury or interest, gambling and excessive uncertainty. It also includes the exclusion of investments that derive a majority of their income from the sale of alcohol, pork products, pornography, gambling, military equipment, or weapons.\n\nIn the MRHB DeFi ecosystem, all crypto assets are screened against Shariah criteria in order to be considered as permissible to deal with. In this process we put them into very distinct categories to begin with and this will help us establish how they must be treated from a Shariah perspective.\n\nThe MRHB Ecosystem aims for a wide array of crypto based decentralized financial solutions, which will be scaled up and expanded as per the roadmap and contribution from its community and R&D Team. The platform will be powered by $MRHB token. The key offerings are:\n\n*   Sahal Wallet/WebApp\n*   The Souq NFT (sNFT) Platform\n*   The Liquidity Harvester\n*   The Dexregator — A Cross Chain DEX Aggregator\n*   Decentralized Philanthropy (DePhi)\n*   Autonomous Governance (DAG)\n*   Launchpad\n*   Parachain\n*   DAO Treasury\n\n[**Click here for MRHB Whitepaper**](https://marhabadefi.com/info-centre.php)\n\n**About MRHB DeFi**\n===================\n\nMRHB DeFi is a platform built to embody the true spirit of an “Inclusive DeFi” by promoting participation finance, where all communities, including the ones from the Islamic World, can benefit from the benefits of DeFi.\n\nBased on the tenets of Blockchain such as trust, transparency, and security; MRHB DeFi has encapsulated universally applicable principles of Shariah into those tenets of Blockchain to render a suite of offerings.\n\nMRHB DeFi was founded with the vision of bringing a “Muslim also” platform, rather than making it an exclusive “Muslim only” offering.\n\nWe are a diverse team of researchers, technocrats, influencers, islamic fintech experts & business entrepreneurs, who came together to ensure that MRHB DeFi prevails in a manner that will impact society as a whole, essentially bridging the gap between the Faith-Conscious Communities and the Blockchain world.\n\n**Read more about MRHB DeFi here:**\n\n[Website](https://marhabadefi.com/info-centre.php) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marhabadefi) | [Telegram Chat](https://t.me/mdf_official) | [Telegram Announcements](https://t.me/marhabadefi_ANN) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@marhabadefi) | [Documents](https://marhabadefi.com/info-centre.php) | [Facebook](https://facebook.com/marhabadefi) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marhabadefi/) | [Telegram Arabic Community](https://t.me/mdf_arabic)","createdAt":"2022-11-15T20:51:22.186Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-15T20:51:22.186Z","publishedAt":"2022-11-15T20:51:22.176Z","locale":"en","Url":"mrhb-defi-releases-pioneering-whitepaper-for-an-inclusive-defi-shariah-compliant-platform","meta":"","cover":{"data":{"id":148,"attributes":{"name":"MRHB DeFi releases pioneering whitepaper for an Inclusive DeFi Shariah Compliant platform cover.jpg","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":1400,"height":787,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/large_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd.jpg","hash":"large_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"large_MRHB DeFi releases pioneering whitepaper for an Inclusive DeFi Shariah Compliant platform cover.jpg","path":null,"size":33.07,"width":1000,"height":562},"small":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/small_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd.jpg","hash":"small_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"small_MRHB DeFi releases pioneering whitepaper for an Inclusive DeFi Shariah Compliant platform cover.jpg","path":null,"size":14.76,"width":500,"height":281},"medium":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd.jpg","hash":"medium_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"medium_MRHB DeFi releases pioneering whitepaper for an Inclusive DeFi Shariah Compliant platform cover.jpg","path":null,"size":23.42,"width":750,"height":422},"thumbnail":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"thumbnail_MRHB DeFi releases pioneering whitepaper for an Inclusive DeFi Shariah Compliant platform cover.jpg","path":null,"size":5.83,"width":245,"height":138}},"hash":"MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":36.56,"url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/MRHB_De_Fi_releases_pioneering_whitepaper_for_an_Inclusive_De_Fi_Shariah_Compliant_platform_cover_7906ac4bdd.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-12-28T12:53:25.874Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-28T12:53:25.874Z"}}},"authors":{"data":[]}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
