It believes there is an opportunity to turn crypto’s energy use into a vast new source of renewable energy demand. The crypto and blockchain sector is naturally poised to become an early adopter of digitized renewable energy and climate solutions that will set an example for other sectors to follow. Energy Web, RMI, and AIR launched the CCA in April 2021 to help coordinate efforts in support of the CCA around open-source technology development, energy and carbon standard-setting, and regulatory engagement.\n\nWho owns the CCA\n================\n\nIn the ѕріrіt of dесеntrаlіzаtіоn, nо оnе owns thе CCA, and everyone hаѕ thіѕ open ѕрасе tо contribute аѕ muсh as thеу саn tо decarbonize crypto.\n\nMRHB DeFi ѕupports the CCA\n==========================\n\nIn line with our stand on financial and business principles based on ethics, MRHB DeFi is proud to sign the [Crypto Climate Accord](https://cryptoclimate.org/supporters/) earlier this week. We are glad for the opportunity to support this initiative towards renewably-powered blockchain solutions that meet the green requirements of the CCA.\n\nAs a CCA signatory, MRHB DeFi has made a public commitment to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption associated with all of our crypto-related operations by 2030 using the best industry practices. We will try our best to be as forthcoming as possible with ideas, insights and solutions so that we can support the decarbonizing efforts of the crypto industry collective and create wins for both the planet and the global economy.\n\n**About MRHB DeFi**\n===================\n\nMRHB DeFi is a halal, decentralised finance platform built to embody the true spirit of an “Ethical and Inclusive DeFi” by following faith-based financial and business principles, where all excluded communities can benefit from the full empowerment potential of DeFi.\n\nBased on the tenets of blockchain such as trust, transparency, and security, MRHB DeFi has encapsulated universally applicable principles of Shariah into those tenets of blockchain to render a suite of offerings.
