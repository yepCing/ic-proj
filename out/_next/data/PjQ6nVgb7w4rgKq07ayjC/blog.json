Is There A Halal DeFi Solution?","date":"2023-02-02","content":"Imagine a financial system where you don’t have to rely on expensive and fallible third parties to manage your money. You have **complete control of all your assets** and you can easily send them to anyone anywhere. Well, imagine no more; decentralized finance (DeFi) exists so you can fully take charge of your financial assets. \n\nIf you haven’t quite got your head around DeFi, this article will give you some clarity. We will also explore whether Islamic or **halal DeFi** on the blockchain is possible with halal crypto and decentralized applications. \n\n&nbsp;\n## What Is DeFi? \n\n[Decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) is a blockchain-based technology that uses secure distributed ledgers to record financial transactions. DeFi platforms are built with a multi-layered architecture that facilitates direct exchanges between participants, eliminating the need for third-party mediators. This is done by programming self-executing smart contract codes to transfer and store digital assets. \n\n&nbsp;\n## History of DeFi \n\nThe term DeFi was first used in 2018 on a [Telegram chat](https://mawsoninc.com/the-history-of-defi/) between Ethereum developers and early investors. Ethereum is a blockchain technology created by Vitalik Buterin as a decentralized ecosystem for building apps and transacting assets.  \n\nWhile the term DeFi has only surfaced in recent years, the concept has been around since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009 – a key enabler for the whole cryptocurrency industry.  \n\nHowever, **Bitcoin did not have the capacity for a robust financial system**. Its simple and limited programming language called Script did not allow for services such as lending, borrowing and trading. \n\nThis limiting factor was one of the reasons that encouraged Buterin to build Ethereum in 2015.\n\nWith Solidity as its programming language, the Ethereum network is able to support a complex range of financial functions using **smart contracts**.  \n\nIt was not until December 2017 with the [launch of MakerDAO](https://finematics.com/history-of-defi-explained/) that DeFi truly started to kick off. This was followed by a stream of DeFi projects such as Compound Finance, Uniswap, and Balancer. \n\nEvery new platform rose as an improved version of Ethereum-based financial technology providing better opportunities to digital asset owners.\n\n&nbsp;\n## Key Characteristics of DeFi \n\nDeFi is a network of protocols and applications that serve a new mode of financial management. It simplifies transactions and enhances the accessibility of investments by reaching a wider audience. \n\n**The following are the defining features of DeFi:**\n\n### Decentralized \n\nTraditional financial systems rely on centralized financial institutions such as banks and third-party intermediaries to facilitate transactions between people. On the other hand, DeFi is described as a “**non-custodial**” system. This means that DeFi apps do not have custody over your assets. You are in complete control of your crypto wallet and funds while benefiting from secure peer-to-peer transactions.\n\n### Open and transparent  \n\nDeFi uses a **distributed database** that records every transaction on the blockchain, which is verified by validators across the globe. Anyone can inspect and track the transactions but they would not be able to modify as transactions on the blockchain are immutable.  \n\n### Interactive and composable \n\nBlocks of transactions are stored on decentralized applications (DApps) that are built by developers using [open-source codes](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source). This enables the innovation of apps that can **support complex financial services** to suit the needs of niche communities. This feature, along with the inherent unchangeable nature of crypto-based ledgers provides a secure platform for digital assets.\n\n&nbsp;\n## Pros and Cons of DeFi \n\nThe DeFi system is constantly evolving to meet emerging challenges in the sphere of digital finance. The regulation-free nature of blockchain technology generates a unique combination of pros and cons for DeFi users.  \n\n&nbsp;\n### Benefits of DeFi \n\n**1. Greater freedom and autonomy**\n\nThe decentralized nature of DeFi allows users to maintain anonymity while engaging in financial activities around the world. Although the transaction is made in the public domain, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remain non-custodial and free of middlemen. This allows users to have complete control over their digital funds. \n\n&nbsp;\n**2. Speed and simplicity**\n\nFinancial ventures based on web3 are known for easy accessibility and hassle-free dealerships. Individuals can use specialized algorithms to match with a peer who can meet their needs in terms of asset borrowing, investment goals, and time scales. Players can then enter into private contracts where they can exchange assets via blockchain-supported DApps.  \n\nPopular cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask, Coinbase, and [Sahal](https://mrhb.network/ecosystem/sahal-wallet) can be used to interact with multiple web3 financial DApps. This reduces the strict gatekeeping and delay that are typical of traditional financial institutions. \n\n&nbsp;\n**3. High security**\n\nDeFi utilizes cryptocurrencies to facilitate financial transactions through immutable smart contracts. This creates a high level of security and confidentiality in asset management. Furthermore, DEXs reduce the risk of theft from hacking or price manipulation by maintaining an encrypted history of all financial movements on its platform. \n\n&nbsp;\n### Disadvantages of DeFi \n\n**1. Risk of fraud and scams**\n\nWith the rising number of DeFi projects competing for market share, consumers may find it difficult to locate trustworthy platforms for investment. Since DeFi projects do not take responsibility for verifying user legitimacy, there is an opportunity for cybercriminals to employ crypto trading for illegal activities. \n\n**2. Volatility**\n\nAs an emerging asset class, cyptocurrency is still volatile. This means that the price of crypto assets can show significant upward or downward movement over a short period. As crypto assets are used within DeFi, this may be a cause of concern for users.\n\nTo reduce volatility-related concerns, [stablecoins](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/) were developed in an attempt to peg their market value to non-cryptocurrency-based assets. Stable assets such as gold or the US Dollar are commonly used as valuation references for Stablecoin. \n\n&nbsp;\n## Can DeFi Support Islamic Finance? \n\n[Islamic Finance](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/islamic_investing.asp) refers to a set of business and investment practices that deal with money according to Islamic principles.  \n\n**The key tenets of Islamic Finance include:**\n\n- Socially responsible and ethical investments i.e., investing in activities such as alcohol, gambling, and others are forbidden. \n\n- Avoidance of riba (usury) and gharar (deception) in financial activties. \n\n- Prohibition of lending with an interest payment at the borrower's expense. \n\n&nbsp;\nAs to the question of DeFi's compatibility with Islamic law, a conscious individual must investigate whether a DeFi project complies with Islamic principles.  \n\nThe crypto tokens used in the project as well as the project mechanism must be **free of exploitative lending schemes** to be considered Halal or permissible for investment. As such, a halal DeFi project would need to use halal crypto tokens for value exchange. \n\n&nbsp;\n## MRHB Integrates Islamic Finance with DeFi \n\nTo facilitate ethically-sound investment in the [web3](https://mrhb.network/blog/intro-to-web3) space, MRHB has built the world’s first halal DeFi ecosystem. The aim is to enhance financial inclusion for the faith-based community and provide support for wealth creation and preservation. Each cryptocurrency and protocol is vetted through by a smart contract “filter” as well as the [Shariah Governance Board](https://mrhb.network/about/governance). \n\nThe gateway to halal crypto awaits you; [download Sahal wallet](https://mrhb.network/ecosystem/sahal-wallet) app for easy access.

More people are realizing that they can invest and save money in gold, which is widely considered an [inflation-proof investment](https://mrhb.network/blog/why-invest-tokenized-gold-silver).\n\nDespite the crypto bear market, the TijarX Gold Rush has attracted **over 420 participants** across many countries. This is the result of successfully reaching **communities in different languages** such as English, Arabic, Persian, Kazakh, and Russian who may see gold as a good hedge against the bear market or are just starting out with investing in gold. \n\n&nbsp;\n## What is the TijarX Gold Rush \n\nThe [TijarX Gold Rush](https://mrhb.network/blog/tijarx-gold-rush) is a two-week-long competition to encourage the MRHB community to invest in gold. **The tokenized gold on TijarX is 100% backed by fully allocated gold bullion** secured by the Gold & Silver Standard of Ainslie Bullion Group. \n\nWinners will be rewarded from a pool of **USD 10,000** worth of tokenized gold with the grand prize winner being awarded USD 5,000 and the second and third placed winners winning USD 3,000 and USD 1,000 respectively in tokenized gold. There will also be 10 lucky draw winners receiving USD 100 in tokenized gold each. This competition ends 31 January 2023. \n\nAs the contest is based on net buys and not transaction volumes for each participant, even late entrants to the competition enjoy the same opportunities as earlier participants. \n\nThe more experienced investors would see this as an **opportunity to protect their wealth** in the bear market. It is widely known that gold is a good hedge against inflation as the price of gold has been stable throughout the years compared to fiat.\n\nThe TijarX Gold Rush is also a way to **guide beginners into investing in gold easily**. The fact that TijarX is a decentralized platform creates a low barrier to entry where anyone from anywhere can start investing in gold. \n\n&nbsp;\n## TijarX: Decentralized Commodity Exchange (Commodity DEX) \n\nTijarX is part of the MRHB decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem that aims to **support the more than [1.7 billion unbanked](https://borgenproject.org/unbanked-population/) and faith-based communities**. \n\nBecause the traditional commodity markets are often inaccessible, complex, expensive and inefficient, MRHB has created a **halal DeFi solution**. As a decentralized commodity exchange, [TijarX solves the problems](https://mrhb.network/blog/tijarx-commodity-trading) by ensuring that transactions are cheaper, borderless and accessible. \n\nCurrently, TijarX offers tokenized gold and silver that are 100% backed by fully allocated gold and silver bullion respectively. In its complete form, TijarX will be able to support all types of asset-backed tokenized commodities. \n\n&nbsp;\n## MRHB Trailblazing Halal DeFi and Halal Crypto \n\nMRHB is on a mission to provide **inclusive and ethical access** to interest-free halal DeFi opportunities on web3 through safe and simple platforms. All of MRHB products can be accessed via its flagship product, **the Sahal Wallet**, which only lists **halal crypto** and DeFi projects. The [MRHB Shariah Scholars](https://mrhb.network/about/governance) determines the permissibility of a crypto project based on Islamic principles.\n\nAs such, the MRHB Ecosystem is set up to support and bring everyone, especially the faith-based communities, safely into DeFi.

As the official Web3 partner, MRHB minted Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) via Souq NFT for the summit participants as proof of attendance. This was also an opportunity to introduce the MRHB ethical DeFi ecosystem to the 1.7 billion faith-based communities that tend to be excluded in the primarily interest-based DeFi space. \n\n&nbsp;\n## What Is The World Halal Summit? \n\nThe [World Halal Summit](https://worldhalalsummit.com.tr/en/) is the largest annual halal event showcasing the latest developments in the global halal sector. International academicians and Islamic scholars congregrate and discuss current topics at the conference. The topics include but not limited to finance, tourism, food, medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics, textile, and modest fashion. The summit also hosts the Halal Expo whereby vendors from various industries exhibit their products and services. \n\nThis year, MRHB (pronounced ‘Marhaba’) had the opportunity to attend the summit representing Web3 and the blockchain industry.\n\n![halal summit-mrhb team.jpg](https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/halal_summit_mrhb_team_38625c8847.jpg)\n_<center> MRHB Team at Istanbul World Halal Summit 2022 </center>_\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe MRHB Team in attendance included Founder and CEO Naquib Mohammed, Chairman Khalid Howladar, Chief Commercial Officer Firas Singer, Chief Technological Officer Deniz Dalkilic, Head of Marketing Ahmed Jawa, and Head of Turkish Community Aslan Resit.  \n\n![halal summit-naquib-aslan.jpg](https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/halal_summit_naquib_aslan_22c2f2753c.jpg)\n_<center> Naquib and Aslan wearing MRHB t-shirts </center>_\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAt MRHB’s booth ([watch this short video on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarhabaDeFi/status/1595431509158240257)), the team interacted with the attendees and presented the currently available halal DeFi products namely Sahal, Souq NFT and TijarX.  \n\n&nbsp;\n## What Is A Soulbound Token? \n\nA Soulbound Token (SBT) is a **non-transferable and publicly verifiable** digital token. It could be thought of as a non-fungible token (NFT) but it actually expands the use cases of NFTs.  \n\nWhere NFTs are transferable, an SBT cannot be transferred. Because of this unique feature, it can serve as a verifiable proof of attendance as well as [for immutable records](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-a-soulbound-token) such as employment history, work experience, and academic credentials. \n\n![mrhb_article_5_SBT halal summit.jpg](https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mrhb_article_5_SBT_halal_summit_7d6fdc8b6a.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\nIn the case of the World Halal Summit, MRHB’s SBTs served as an immutable digital event ticket that undeniably proved the ownership of the ticket holder and verified their attendance. \n\nCompanies can now mint their own SBTs on Web3 via [Souq NFT](https://souq.mrhb.network/). By doing so, they will not only be participating in blockchain technology but also supporting halal crypto.\n\n&nbsp;\n## Bringing Halal DeFi to Istanbul \n\nWhile Web3 concepts like Soulbound Tokens may be new to the mainstream or non-crypto natives, attendees at the World Halal Summit were excited to see a project working towards **solving the issue of financial inclusion** within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space where 1.7 billion faith-based communities are often excluded. \n\nEven though they may not completely understand crypto, they now know that **MRHB exists as a halal crypto solution**. When they need our services, we will be available and ready to provide them.  \n\nThe SBTs were probably the first interaction that the attendees had with Web3. Despite the rather difficult learning curve, the SBTs piqued their interest and they were **open to learning more**. Suffice to say, it was an honor and a delight to show the potential of MRHB DeFi to the halal community. \n\nThis is why MRHB’s presence was important. The more exposure and impression a Web3 project has on people, the higher the chance for widespread adoption of blockchain technology. \n\n&nbsp;\n## MRHB The Halal DeFi Solution \n\nBesides Souq NFT where you can mint NFTs and SBTs, MRHB also has a self-custodial multichain digital wallet app where you can see a list of halal crypto tokens, buy and sell cryptocurrenices, and access the rest of the MRHB DeFi ecosystem. With its simple interface, you will find it easy to navigate [Sahal Wallet](https://mrhb.network/ecosystem/sahal-wallet).  \n\nWhat’s more, you can save your friends’ wallet address in ‘My Contacts’ for ease of fund transfer. Sahal Wallet does not collect your personal information, private keys, and IP addresses so you can be sure that your funds are always safe in Sahal. \n\n[![mrhb sahal wallet is the gateway to the entire defi ecosystem](https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mrhb_sahal_wallet_3_836f602b3f.jpg)](https://mrhb.network/ecosystem/sahal-wallet)","createdAt":"2023-01-09T08:55:08.913Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-09T09:17:35.328Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-09T09:00:17.080Z","locale":"en","Url":"halal-crypto-istanbul-world-halal-summit-2022","meta":"MRHB was the official Web3 partner at the World Halal Summit 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey bringing halal crypto solution to the mainstream with Soulbound Tokens.

As crypto proliferates the Middle East from Europe, Turkey took it upon itself to host one of the biggest blockchain events of the year—[**Istanbul Blockchain Week (IBW)**](https://istanbulblockchainweek.com/). \n\nMore than [2,000 attendees](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-ftx-collapse-not-enough-to-break-crypto-community-s-spirit-ibw-2022) from all over the world attended Turkey’s first-ever blockchain week. Fom 14 to 17 Nov, various events celebrating blockchain and web3 were held. \n\n- **IstanBlock:** the flagship event and premier blockchain conference \n- **IstanDAO:** where DAOs come together to shape web3 future \n- **IstanHack:** participants building innovative products and tech solutions \n- **W3E Gaming:** showing the future of web3 gaming \n- **NFT Day:** celebrating NFT content within various industries \n\nMRHB’s Cecilia Wong (Head of PR) attended the inaugural event and shared the following highlights: \n\n&nbsp;\n## Turkey’s Stance on Blockchain Technology \n\nAccording to **Ziya Altunyaldız** (President of the Republic of Turkey Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Industry, Trade, Energy, Natural Resources, Information and Technology Commission), Turkey sees **blockchain technology as more than a digital money transfer system**.  \n“[It] is an epoch making development in digitalization which enhances trust, security, transparency and traceability,” said Altunyaldız. “The years ahead will be reshaped by blockchain technology.” \n\nIt is clear that Turkey wants to be \"one of the pioneers of the transformation, give directions and benefit from it\". They aim to realize these goals in \"a way that prioritizes human rights”. \n\n&nbsp;\n## Steps Important for Mass Adoption \n\nTurkey recognizes the importance of mass adoption and the work that needs to be done in order to attract more people towards [web3](https://mrhb.network/blog/intro-to-web3). \n\nThe following are a few suggestions made during IBW 2022 on the actions to be taken for mass adoption in crypto: \n\n### 1. More players in the crypto industry \n\n“The crypto industry is still very small, we are trying to create a core ecosystem. I think it is very good for more layer 1 and layer 2 to come in so they can attract new attention with the new resources.” - Zoe Wei, Senior Business Director at BNB Chain. \n\n“It's going to be a multichain future. The more good players are out there, that are working with integrity and are committed to improve the technology… That means the gospel will reach more ears.” - Selim Kender, Head of Turkish Business Development at Ava Labs.\n\n### 2. Have better crypto custody solutions \n\n\"Not everybody is so clever to... move money from different blockchains. The typical investor has no clue, and also the typical investor doesn’t want to take care of any kind of keys.” - Alireza Dorfard, Head of Market Data and Services, Deutsche Borse. \n\n### 3. VCs willing to take smart risks \n\n“Nowadays everyone thinks we had a huge advantage from being a first mover. But the truth is that, at the time, we looked pretty crazy. Our first investment was Chainlink, and this was even before smart contracts became popularized by dapps.” - Brandon Potts, Investor at Framework Ventures. \n\n### 4. More education and awareness \n\nWhat most speakers pointed out was that there needs to be more education in general with regards to cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and the web3 space. The role of DAOs (member-owned communities without centralized leaderships) need to be made clearer. DAOs have the potential to provide safe ways for collaborations and commit funds to specific causes.\n\n## MRHB: An Ethical, Empowering and Easy SuperDApp for Halal Web3 Access \n\nIBW 2022 proved that despite the crypto bear market and failures of FTX and Terra, the interest and enthusiasm in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) remains high. Crypto projects continue to be built and the crypto community gets stronger every day. \n\nMass adoption will take time and MRHB is one of the web3 pioneers focused on DeFi and digital asset solutions for communities looking for a  safer, more ethical and easier approach to the crypto universe that will also empower them to participate. \n\n**MRHB is the world’s first ethical DeFi ecosystem** that operates based on halal financial  ethics and principles that put the commuity first. Many of the current DeFi protocols available are lending and interest-based, this excludes over 1.7 billion plus of the faith-based communities around the world. More generally there have been a series of events in the industry that epitomize much of the greed and corruption inherent in the industry – thus many consumers are looking for safer and more trusted means to access the sector. \n\nTo encourage mass adoption, the crypto industry has to include and consider the needs of ethically conscious people.  \n\n**MRHB is proud to be the pioneer of ethical DeFi**. Within the first two years of operation, we have released three halal DeFi products:\n\n- **Sahal wallet:** self-custodial crypto wallet that lists only halal crypto assets and protocols \n\n- **TijarX:** decentralized commodity exchange listing real-world assets – initially physical backed and regulated gold and silver. \n\n- **Souq NFT:** marketplace for the minting and selling of NFTs and the home of their B2B  NFT solutions business. \n\nGet started with investing in halal crypto assets by downloading [Sahal wallet](https://mrhb.network/ecosystem/sahal-wallet) from the app store – the gateway to the entire [MRHB ethical DeFi ecosystem](https://mrhb.network/blog/how-mrhb-is-building-a-halal-and-ethical-defi-ecosystem).","createdAt":"2022-12-29T02:08:52.174Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-04T10:26:08.390Z","publishedAt":"2022-12-30T04:00:00.071Z","locale":"en","Url":"2022-istanbul-blockchain-week-mrhb-ethical-defi","meta":"Istanbul Blockchain Week (IBW) 2022 was Turkey’s inaugural blockchain week event celebrating web3 and MRHB Ethical DeFi team shares some highlights.","cover":{"data":{"id":169,"attributes":{"name":"mrhb_article_2_IBW.jpg","alternativeText":"mrhb_article_2_IBW.jpg","caption":"mrhb_article_2_IBW.jpg","width":4000,"height":2251,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/large_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed.jpg","hash":"large_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"large_mrhb_article_2_IBW.jpg","path":null,"size":82.79,"width":1000,"height":563},"small":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/small_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed.jpg","hash":"small_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"small_mrhb_article_2_IBW.jpg","path":null,"size":29.38,"width":500,"height":281},"medium":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed.jpg","hash":"medium_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"medium_mrhb_article_2_IBW.jpg","path":null,"size":53.54,"width":750,"height":422},"thumbnail":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"thumbnail_mrhb_article_2_IBW.jpg","path":null,"size":9.66,"width":245,"height":138}},"hash":"mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":542.67,"url":"https://mrhb-strapi-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mrhb_article_2_IBW_f3d216d1ed.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-12-29T02:00:30.880Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-29T02:00:30.880Z"}}},"authors":{"data":[]}}},{"id":76,"attributes":{"title":"Crypto Regulation & Ethical DeFi: Highlights of TOKEN2049 Singapore & London 2022","date":"2022-12-28","content":"The crypto winter of 2022 had nothing on TOKEN2049. Attendees flocked to the annual crypto event, taking the opportunity to gain insights from leaders in the crypto industry. This article covers the highlights at the events in Singapore and London, including the tug-of-war between regulation and decentralization. \n\n&nbsp;\n## What is TOKEN2049? \n\n[TOKEN2049](https://www.token2049.com/) is a premier crypto event bringing together the leading voices in crypto to share their views on the current market. It is held at two cities annually — Singapore and London. \n\nBesides the series of panel discussion, other activities include workshops, meetups, and hackathon. These activities serve the overall aim to unite entrepreneurs, investors, developers, industry enthusiasts, and global media under the crypto umbrella. \n\nPast speakers include Vitalik Buterin (Co-Founder of Ethereum), Stani Kulechov (Founder and CEO of Aave), and Charlie Lee (Creator of Litecoin). \n\nWhile both events in Singapore and London share the same objective, there may be slight differences with regards to the topic of conversation due to the rapid development in the crypto industry. \n\n&nbsp;\n## TOKEN2049 Singapore Highlights \n\nThe main topics covered at the Singapore conference in September 2022 were the ongoing crypto winter, adoption by mainstream finance, and regulation. \n\nIt is undeniable that crypto **adoption by the traditional finance** (TradFi) industry is a love-hate proposition. While there are concerns that TradFi might betray the core principles of crypto, their involvement  adds much needed liquidity in the space and gives it a sense of respectability.\n\nAlexander Höptner, Former CEO of the crypto trading platform BitMEX [said](https://forkast.news/institutional-finance-regulators-token2049/) that the current bear market, far from sowing doubts among institutional finance players, was encouraging them to pile in. \n\nDuring this TOKEN2049 conference, it was explained that **institutional interest in crypto continues to grow** due to two factors: \n\n1. The ‘flight-to-quality’ trend i.e. the simultaneous event of a stock market crash with a boom in crypto as observed in past years.\n\n2. Current price levels that represent a really interesting entry point for investors. \n\n&nbsp;\nIn terms of **regulation**, while speakers at TOKEN2049 Singapore raised concerns on this issue, they also demonstrated a willingness to embrace discipline **for the benefit of their customers**, their own **longer-term interests**, and the development of the sector. \n\nRegulatory oversight used to be seen as a bad thing as the idea opposes the concept of decentralization that was put forth by Bitcoin. However, it seems that the sentiment is changing as leaders not only see regulations as removing uncertainty but also improving the speed of innovation. \n\n&nbsp;\n## TOKEN2049 London Highlights \n\nWhile only two months apart, the conversation at TOKEN2049 London in November had a different tone. According to Cecilia Wong (MRHB’s Head of PR), due to the [FTX debacle](https://mrhb.network/blog/ftx-islamic-finance), the conference focused more towards **transparency** and **decentralization**. \n\nWhile a typical response to fraud  would be to increase regulations, which speakers at the Singapore conference alluded to, this might not satisfy the need for decentralization. Instead of a centralized regulatory approach, industry players could consider a more transparent and community-oriented approach **guided by ethics and integrity.**  \n\n**Smart contract protocols** whereby ethical guidance is built into the code (more on this later) could very well be the answer to both decentralization and transparency demands.  \n\nTOKEN2049 London also touched on **data privacy** in the age of surveillance capitalism, **NFTs**, and **digital property rights**. As the growing alliance of state and private industry undermine privacy and individual autonomy, more innovations to existing decentralized technologies will be much welcomed. \n\n Overall, the feel at Token2049 was that [opportunities for Web3](https://mrhb.network/blog/how-web3-can-benefit-web2-companies) are very promising and this is a sector that will no doubt continue to keep growing. \n\n&nbsp;\n## MRHB — The Future of Ethical DeFi \n\nTOKEN2049 highlighted the issues of **regulation, transparency, and a lack of ethics**, which led to an abuse of customers’ trust and their funds. \n\n_Where then do we go from here?_\n\nImplementing regulation, while convenient and attractive to TradFi investors, may ruffle the feathers of some crypto natives and proponents of decentralization. But without regulation, it can be difficult to keep bad players accountable and prevent them from stealing funds. \n\nWe may already have the answer as well as the means.  \n\nInstead of implementing centralized TradFi systems with obvious points of failure, it might be worth focusing more on **innovating decentralized systems** with ethics coded in the smart contracts. \n\nRecognizing the need for both security, transparency and decentralization, MRHB has been way ahead of the curve with the **[ethical DeFi](https://mrhb.network/blog/how-mrhb-is-building-a-halal-and-ethical-defi-ecosystem)** ecosystem it is building with interest-free halal DeFi products that would satisfy the needs of faith-based and ethically conscious communities. \n\nSupport an ethical DeFi future by downloading the multi-chain self-custodial [Sahal Wallet—the gateway to the entire MRHB ecosystem](https://mrhb.network/ecosystem/sahal-wallet).

During an economic downturn, you might notice that more people tend to invest in precious metals. A UK-based gold dealer even claimed that he [ran out of gold](https://cryptosaurus.tech/report-uk-gold-dealer-sells-out-of-bullion-after-pounds-record-fall-demand-skyrockets/) coins and bars due to increased demand during this economically turbulent time. \n\nWhile investing in gold and silver has been a popular means of diversifying one’s portfolio, it may have its drawbacks such as high cost, fees and taxes. But with tokenization of precious metals via blockchain technology, these issues may become obsolete. \n\n## What Is Tokenized Gold and Silver? \n\nTokenization refers to the process of transforming ownership and rights of assets into a digital form that is usable on a blockchain, with each token representing a share of ownership in the underlying asset.\n\nYou might be familiar with non-fungible tokens or NFTs whereby unique, valuable items such as art, music and collectibles are tokenized. In a similar vein, commodities such as gold, silver and other raw materials can also be tokenized. The only difference is that NFTs are the assets themselves whereas tokenized commodities represent real-world items.\n\nWhile they may not be unique, non-interchangeable digital assets, tokenized commodities allow an investor to own even a small amount of the asset.\n\n## Why People Invest in Gold and Silver \n\nBefore we get into the benefits of investing in tokenized assets, let’s look at why gold and silver as precious metals have been very much sought after and are considered worthy investments. \n\n### 1. Unique physical properties\nLet's face it — precious metals are enticing and valuable. This is not just because of their shiny appearance but also the fact that they are durable. They can essentially last for a long time and yet they can also be shaped into different forms. The malleability is what allows precious metals to be turned into coins, bullions or jewellery. \n\n### 2. Inflation-proof\nGold and silver have limited supply. As such, it is deflationary by nature and the price either appreciates or remain constant. When something of value is scarce, there is always demand. And so, gold and silver usually perform well even during a recession.\n\n### 3. Universally and consistently valued  \n\nSince gold and silver are inflation-proof, their value remains constant throughout time. These precious metals—once their properties are known and appreciated—have been universally valued ever since [before century era](https://getacregold.com/blogs/news/when-was-gold-discovered) and continue to spark interest today.\n\n### 4. Generational investment \nPrecious metals have been used as generational investment. They are typically passed down from one generation to the next as family heirlooms. While their value may seem constant in a short period of time, it shows an [upward trend](https://investing-abc.com/why-to-invest-in-gold-and-silver/) in the long run. So if, for example, the fourth generation decides to sell the family gold, they may gain some profit.\n\n&nbsp;\n## The Issues With Traditional Commodity Market\n\nLet's take gold as an example.\n\nGold's supply is relatively constant and so it's considered an efficient asset for diversifying portfolio especially during inflation or economic downturn.\n\nThe [3 main ways to invest in gold](https://education.howthemarketworks.com/investing-in-gold-how-does-the-gold-market-work/) in the traditional market include: \n- buying physical gold\n- trading gold ETFs\n- through gold certificates\n\n&nbsp;\nWhile these methods do give the result of adding gold asset to an investment portfolio, they come with a set of drawbacks.\n\n**Buying physical gold**, especially gold coins, is the most reliable and easy to obtain. However, if you want to purchase a higher quantity, you may face the problem of keeping them securely. Most investors would keep the gold bullion in a trusted vault and that would require additional fees. Same goes to transporting the assets from one place to another.\n\n**Trading gold ETFs** is just like buying shares that are backed by the real asset. This is more convenient way to trade than physical gold. You wouldn't have to worry about storing them securely. However, with gold ETFs, you don't actually own the asset per se and you can only redeem it for cash, not the gold itself. What's more, every time you buy and sell a gold ETF, you would need to pay a commission to the broker i.e., the third party. Any profits you make must be reported as tax.\n\n**Gold certificates** represent your claim on a specified amount of gold. Just like gold ETFs, they are easier to exchange and you don't have to worry about storage. One major drawback is that they are as good as the company issuing them. So if the company goes bankrupt, you may lose all your investment.\n\n&nbsp;\n## Why Investing in Tokenized Gold and Silver Is Better \n\n**High fees and logistical complexity** are the two main issues with traditional commodity trading. For years, there wasn't really a solution and investors would just deal with the drawbacks.\n\nNow, there is an alternative thanks to the advent of blockchain technology.\n\n**Asset-backed tokens** are similar to gold ETFs but with added security and minus intermediaries, meaning **cheaper and more efficient trading**.\n\n### Benefits of trading tokenized gold and silver\n\n1. **Fractional ownership:** you don't need to purchase a full gold bar and can instead invest in one you can afford.\n2. **Increase efficiency:** since there are no intermediaries or third party involvement, trading tokenized assets are faster and cheaper as no operational cost is imposed. \n3. **Increase liquidity:** tokenized assets on decentralized exchanges have the potential to makes traditional assets more liquid as transactions are more rapid. \n4. **Promote transparency:** tokenized asset trading is done on the blockchain which means transactions are recorded in a transparent, permanent and immutable manner.\n5. **Support financial inclusion:** anyone regardless of financial status or economic background can invest in the gold market by buying micro or macro amounts of the tokenized asset.\n\nIn summary, you can invest in tokenized gold and silver in a more secure, easier and cheaper way. \n\n## How to Start Investing in Tokenized Gold and Silver on TijarX \n\nInvesting in gold and silver backed tokens has never been easier. \n\nWith the Sahal wallet, the gateway to the entire MRHB ecosystem, you can invest in tokenized gold and silver on [TijarX](https://mrhb.network/ecosystem/tijarx) commodity exchange in a matter of seconds. \n\nTokenized assets on TijarX are 100% backed by fully allocated gold and silver bullion, redeemable, and secured by the Gold Silver Standard of Ainslie Bullion Group Australia.\n\n**1.
