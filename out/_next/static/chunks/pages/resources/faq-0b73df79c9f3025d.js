As part of the benefits are concerned, we are ensuring that there are sufficiently rewarding returns from our liquidity harvesting mechanisms. We are all working towards making the wealth returns lucrative for everyone."},{question:"What is MarhabaDeFi? and how is the story behind the MarhabaDeFi project creation?",answer:"Marhaba DeFi is a platform built to embody the true spirit of an \u201cInclusive DeFi\u201d by promoting participation finance, where all communities, including the ones from the Islamic World, can benefit from the benefits of DeFi. Based on the tenets of Blockchain such as trust, transparency, and security; Marhaba DeFi has encapsulated universally applicable principles of Shariah into those tenets of Blockchain to render a suite of offerings. Well, Marhaba was incubated when we were researching DeFi protocols. We discovered most of them are strictly non shariah compliant. Hence Marhaba was born to bring shariah based DeFi solutions, to include the Muslim community AS WELL into the defi ecosystem"},{question:"What is the $MRHB token?",answer:"The $MRHB Token is a utility token that offers practical usage and benefits within the M\u22c0RH\u25b3B\u22c0 ecosystem. Moreover, it also serves the primary purpose of payment in the ecosystem and will also be used as a governance token in the future. The SGB ensures that the issuance of MRHB token, its usage, features, current and future benefits and rights attached to it are, and will remain, Shariah compliant. Because all these elements create the utility of the token which in turn forms the main source of value for it. Further discussion can be found in the paper \u201cShariah Concepts of M\u22c0RH\u25b3B\u22c0 DeFi\u201d. "},{question:"Can anyone create an NFT through the Marhaba Souq NFT? ",answer:"Souq NFT will be strictly for Shariah compliant NFTs, regardless of their type i.e. artwork, GIF. The marketplace will be governed closely by the SGB to enforce this requirement with the use of NSFW and NLP machine learning algorithms that M\u22c0RH\u25b3B\u22c0 Finance will incorporate to detect and potentially filter out any negative content such as nudity, adult content, hate speech and racism. Of course, these algorithms are not 100% accurate and the decision to take an NFT to the Shariah board for a manual decision to be made will be subject to a threshold value provided by our \u201cShariah Compliance API\u201d. "},{question:"What does Mudarabah mean? ",answer:"Mudharabah is a profit and loss sharing Islamic contract of partnership in which one party (the Rab al Maal) provides investment capital, and the other (the managing trustee, the Mudharib) contributes with the management expertise "},{question:"Marhaba DeFi brings the first sharia compliant solution to the world of decentralized finance. But what is Shariah? It is the first time that I see this term within finance.",answer:"Shariah means a way of life. Muslim believe that this way of life has been revealed by God though His Messenger. The objectives of shariah are to protect the religion of an individual, to protect his wealth, his life, his honour and his sanity. Hence, a Muslim will have to follow certain rules to achieve these objectives in his/life. For example, He will have to perform certain acts of worship to protect his relation with God. He will have to stay away from intoxicating substances to protect his sanity. He will have to be trading in certain ways to protect his wealth and the wealth of others etc So in essence, having shariah compliant solutions in DeFi, will help Muslims to trade in a way that is in line with their faith. But at the same time, it will benefit other people who are not Muslims, by bringing to them solutions that are ethical to everyone. "},{question:"What does SGB mean? ",answer:"Since compliance with the rules and principles of Shariah in all its offerings is one of the key Unique Selling Points (USP) of Marhaba DeFi, the operations and activities of the Marhaba DeFi are continuously monitored and supervised by a team of well-experienced and highly reputed Shariah Scholars. This in-house team of Shariah Scholars is known as Shariah Compliance Board (SGB). The SGB of Marhaba DeFi is mandated to conduct Shariah screening, shariah review as well as shariah endorsement of all its activities and offerings. Thus, a product or service is qualified for its inclusion in the list of Marhaba DeFi\u2019s offerings only upon the receipt of Shariah approval from the SGB.  "},{question:"What can I do with the Sahal wallet? ",answer:"Sahal Wallet also enables users to trade and perform transactions with their stored crypto assets.
